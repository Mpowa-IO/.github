## The MPOWA Vision

We believe in a world without energy and water scarcity, where the sources of both have no negative effect on our children's health or the environment.  We believe economic disparities must be eliminated, and that we must achieve social and environmental resilience.


To realise this vision the world needs to harness clean technologies and accelerate the decentralisation of energy and water provision, in line with UN Strategic Development Goals (SDGs).  


For potential investors, this offers a clean technology investment opportunity unlike anything else.
